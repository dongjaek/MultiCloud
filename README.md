# MultiCloud
Little project to become acquainted with Java8. Be able to search and upload files to multiple file hosting cloud providers

The plan is to create a simple GUI that lets the user log in to their individual accounts and store
them in a salted and hashed manner on the machine for "security"

Dropbox
Google Drive
Box

After logging into each of the providers you can use a unified gui to search, view, upload and download files
across the cloud providers

Basic representation of the application is a simple directory structure where each cloud is a "root" level
directory and all of it's files are in them.

Dropbox

Google-Drive

Box

The idea is to use JavaFX, Java8 and the HTTP APIs to make it all work. Big learning experience.
